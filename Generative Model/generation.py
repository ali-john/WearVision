Model 1: Generating Human Models from Text Prompts

Research and Model Selection: Start by examining state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models. You might consider transformer models that have been successful in similar tasks.

Data Preprocessing: Use PyTorch's torchvision.transforms for image preprocessing to match your model's input requirements.

Model Training: Utilize a framework like PyTorch Lightning or Hugging Face Transformers to streamline training with PyTorch.

Evaluation and Iteration: Implement evaluation metrics relevant to image generation to guide iterative improvements.
